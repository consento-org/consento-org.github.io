## You are a crypto-millionaire! If only you hadn't lost your crypto wallet key...

__Have you heard how many bitcoin users would have become millionaires, only if they hadn't lost theit password?__
Bitcoins and distributed ledgers technologies opened amazing opportunities to secure transactions online. Although their technicality makes most end-users a bit chill. Moreover, they transform the end-user into the "single point of failure".

__Password managers are presented as the solution. But they just postpone the problem...__
Password manager services seem to solve the everyday authentication issue. But actually, they just postpone the problem; either end-users forget about their master password; either their precious vault with all their precious passwords becomes a centralised vault worth hacking!
