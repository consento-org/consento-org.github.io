## Sharing data with independent contractors leads many of our confidential data to be out of hand.

__Once the confidential data is shared, it has been copied. It is out of your hand.__<br/>
Most of companies relie on the services of external contractors or suppliers, for translation work, transcription, accounting, legal work, etc. Building a trustworthy partnership often starts with complex NDA. And it is there to stay; the partnership is hard to evolve or update.

__The one who receives the confidential data would prefer not to be responsible for it.__<br/>
Eventually, the smaller entreprises or independent workers who eventually receive the confidential documents they have to work on end up bearing an unecessary responsibility over these files. The sender does not want to give away the files, nor the recipient want to have to secure these files.

### With Consento, share the responsibility without losing control over your data.

With Consento app, the files you send are encrypted and remain in that state until you grant access to them to the people of your choice. You can control on which device, at what time or at which location these files are accessed. 

For the recipients, it means that the files remain in the custody of the client, not theirs. The NDA or other lenghty procedures can be reduced, and so is the stress of amanging the confidential data of others.

## User-centric + co-responsibility + access control in your confidential files.
