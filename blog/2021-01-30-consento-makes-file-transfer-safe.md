## Being the cutsodian for contractors' CV or identities adds to the burden of coordinating agencies.

__Having to hold the custody of other's digital identities is timely, if not costly in human error.__<br/>
Most of companies relie on a netwrok of external contractors and suppliers, for translation work, transcription, accounting, legal work, etc. Building a trustworthy partnership often starts with verified credentials, or asking for referals, in order to discard fraudulent candidates. Eventually, these verified CVs and confidential data about contractors become too valuable to be losely shared over emails or cloud services. The agency's reputation depends on it.

__The contractor should not ruin the agency's privacy efforts by using online tools either.__<br/>
How often do freelance translators or transcriptors end up using online tools by conveniency? In doing so, they put the agency's efforts to keep data confidential at risk. Onboarding freelancers to develop a simple security and privacy hygiene ends up being costly. In the end, the agency resolves to share the information and guidances and just hopes for the best.
