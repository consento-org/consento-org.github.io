Consento aims at delivering a novel way to securely store confidential data encrypted without central cloud solution, and access them without depending on complex passwords. Instead, with Consento users can request the consents of peers they have decided to rely on. Such a new way to secure confidential data requires appropriate <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-better-notifications-ux-permission-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX</a> (user experience) &amp; <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-ux-aware-design-framework/?ref=heydesigner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI</a> (user interface) to guide users in handling data privacy. But before discussing about the right UX/UI, we need to discuss a bit about a fundamental object: trust.</p><p>Indeed, before it comes to build trust in the UI, we need to build trust in the system. And before the system, there is the belief in the system. Consento story requires quite some thoughts about various forms of trust: trust in the <em>system</em> build by the web of devices, and in the other <em>peers</em> who act as trustees, if not also trust in the Consento <em>business</em> and team itself. So, to start with, what do we speak about when we speak about trust?</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="trust"></a>Trust<a class="hash-link" href="#trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We like the definition of trust as <em>&quot;a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of another&quot;</em>(<em><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.1998.926617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rousseau et al., 1998</a></em>). Trust depends both on the individual <em>abilities to trust</em> and on the <em>trustworthiness</em> another is able to display.</p><p>Said otherwise, trust is neither a cognitive process nor an innate human feature, it is both (<em><a href="https://www.academia.edu/39355650/The_Roots_of_Trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mújdricza, 2019</a></em>). Studies have shown that trust is an a priori given human faculty, and therefore the possibility of trust is always present. But visual cues, human contexts and past experiences affect positively or negatively the level of trust. <strong>Trust happens to be &#x27;learned&#x27; more than &#x27;earned&#x27;</strong>, and it requires a certain affective warmth for a start.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contemporary-online-experiences-of-trust"></a>Contemporary online experiences of trust<a class="hash-link" href="#contemporary-online-experiences-of-trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Internet users experience online services as a fast pace changing context.  They regularly confront with new offerings, new companies, new standards, etc. In such an uncertain context, the aspect of trustworthiness can be built on social constructs like <em>reliability</em> and on individual constructs like <em>integrity </em>(<em><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.1998.926617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rousseau et al., 1998</a></em>).</p><p>Among the services internet users experience online (<em><a href="https://journalofcloudcomputing.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13677-019-0129-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">van der Werff et al., 2019</a></em>), display of trustworthiness emerge on levels such as reputation systems, third party endorsement, transparency mechanisms, etc. And novel ones keep on emerging.</p><ul><li>The <strong>reputation systems</strong> provide a hint about trustworthiness based on other peers&#x27; previous experiences, as well as an incentive to behave trustworthy. Think for instance about peer-to-peer platforms tw-ways rating systems.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/external/fair-use/blablacar-trust-level.png" class="kg-image" alt="Trust system relevancy.Illustration on the amount of level of trust by bla-bla-car.

Blablacar is a carpooling service.</figcaption></figure><p>In the case of a decentralised architecture like Consento, with no central platform enforcing the rules, that system in itself might be less effective than the reputation in real life of these peers. Research (<em><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2012/trust-in-advertising--paid-owned-and-earned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nielsen, 2012</a></em>) have demonstrated also that despite a tendency to trust more people who are similar to us, high reputation of peers (and stakeholders) eventually beats strong similarity among peers.</p><ul><li>The <strong>endorsement by third parties</strong> such as insurance companies, governmental institutions or civil origins is never a discrediting thing to get. Commercial companies also rely on customers&#x27; endorsements. However, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/authority-principle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> report that online consumers pay little attention to endorsement itself. Third party endorsements bring on credibility more than trust.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/external/fair-use/dropbox-third-party-endrosement.png" class="kg-image" alt="Third parties endorsement from customers, example of Dropbox website.

A personal dramatic event, or a worldwide pandemic for instance, do impact people&#x27;s ability to trust each other or their institutions. Even if Consento is first a digital tool, we remain aware that the evolution of people&#x27;s trust capacities happens mainly off-line.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#x27;nudge&#x27; approach</a> represent an interesting look into that matter. Humans are inherently biased cognitively. For instance, we would rather avoid loosing than risking to win, we weight the same information differently depending on the credits we give to the speaker, we assess value differently depending on the initial frame given to us to look at the matter, etc.</p><p>We have to remember that Cass Sustein and Richard Thaller approach spurred discussion on how much governments or corporations should be allowed to &#x27;nudge&#x27; us to do what they want us to do.

We had a few long and hard discussions, trying to tie down what is necessary for us to figure out. Our priority No. 1 eventually landed on <em>daily usability</em>. We wanted to make sure that whatever product we are building will be useful in everyday life. Ultimately, it means that this has to be on a mobile device; a mobile app.</p><p>This was a problem for us. <em>Yes</em>, we are developers and−<em>yes</em>−we have experience with desktop and server software, but <em>no</em>: our strength is not in mobile apps. We had to learn quickly and make choices. To make this an informed choice we looked at our requirements:</p><ol><li>We need it to be JavaScript based to stay compatible with the <a href="https://datproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dat</a> ecosystem.</li><li>We do not want for the user interface to stutter. This means our code needs to run separately from the UI <em>(in a different thread)</em>.</li></ol><p>Of the two popular choices we found, we went with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native</a> over <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NativeScript</a>. It seems easier to find people with React Native experience. It has a pretty good reputation and we wanted to use React for the user interface. Choosing it seemed the straight-forward choice.</p><p>React Native can be used as-is, but for quicker development we learned that <a href="https://expo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expo.io</a> is really comfortable. Expo limits React Native to a pre-defined set of extensions. This restriction allows the immediate installation on any device, quickly. No need to wait for slow build or publishing processes. − <em>Cool, we definitely want that!</em></p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="design-process"></a>Design Process<a class="hash-link" href="#design-process" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We want to use Open-Source software for as many tasks as possible, as it allows contributors to join freely and quickly. Sadly, we have not found a free design software that works for us. <a href="https://www.sketch.com/get/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sketch</a> is reasonably cheap for a design software, can be used offline, allows some hacking with the format and is overall the only choice we could see−even though it runs only on MacOS. <em>(though .sketch files can be edited using <a href="https://icons8.com/lunacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lunacy</a> on Windows)</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/consento/cc-by-nc-sa/design.png" class="kg-image" alt="Consento, In sketch, as mock and on the device."><footer><small>License: <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a> by <a rel="author" href="https://consento.org/team">Consento</a></small></footer><figcaption>From sketch to mockup to prototype. Marc made some nice designs for us.</figcaption></figure><p>With the design ready we need to turn it into code. We wanted to automate that so we also informed ourselves here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://builderx.io/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BuilderX</a> looked professional but has a steep price tag of 15$/month/person and the output wasn&#x27;t good to use in our opinion. Repeat output would clash with expo and typescript and we had to improve the output by hand.</li><li><a href="https://zeplin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeplin.io</a> is useful for communication and is okay for a copy &amp; paste process but in the long run was going to be painful for updates: What did we already update? Where is the difference between design and code? How do we add the non-trivial features?</li><li><a href="https://github.com/nanohop/sketch-to-react-native" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sketch-to-react-native</a> does sound promising but it exports to JavaScript <em>(and we work with TypeScript)</em> and the output is not suitable for repeat exports. This would allow us to export once and any future update would be problematic.</li></ul><p>After testing a few alternatives we knew what we needed.</p><ol><li>It needs to be able to change the Sketch file repeatedly without breaking the rest of the code.</li><li>It needs to output all the things we need: images, fonts, elements.</li><li>It needs to be free or cheap.</li></ol><p>Since we couldn&#x27;t find any tool to do that, we wrote it ourselves. 🤓 ↓</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="hello-expo-export"></a>Hello, expo-export!<a class="hash-link" href="#hello-expo-export" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>To get the workflow right we built in parallel to our first app <a href="https://github.com/consento-org/expo-export" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expo-export</a>! It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free and opensource software</a>, that you can add as a plugin to Sketch. It will add a menu button that with one click exports the assets, fonts and components of the layers in that sketch file to relative folders.</p><p>In its current version expo-export is rough around many edges but the development has been mostly a breeze and we learned a lot about the capabilities of Sketch. Now, when we create changes in Sketch we can see the updates immediately<em>(-ish)</em> in the mobile app.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/consento/cc-by-nc-sa/screen-recording-live-update.gif" class="kg-image" alt="screen capture showing an iphone simulator updated as the export process in sketch is executed."><footer><small>License: <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a> by <a rel="author" href="https://consento.org/team">Consento</a></small></footer><figcaption>Simulator (or device) is updated quickly after sketch export is triggered.</figcaption></figure><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="security--performance"></a>Security &amp; Performance<a class="hash-link" href="#security--performance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The last topic for this post is about performance. If you try to use Consento right now on a slower device, Consento will be slow! Particularly when adding a new Relation or adding a new file to a vault. The reason for this performance issue is tied to our initial choices <em>(back in the first section)</em>. In order to work with dat, we need to rely on a specific encryption system <em>(libsodium)</em> that is not working fast on react-native.</p><p>We thought initially that this should be the smaller issue and will be easily improved later-on but it turns out that encryption on mobile devices is a pretty big deal. The current version works more-or-less but because of time constraints the current solution is not compatible with dat. 😱</p><p>Maybe we should have gone with NativeScript as a platform? NativeScript has a synchronous <a href="https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-libsodium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libsodium plugin</a> after all, though <a href="https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-libsodium#ios-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">without iOS support</a>. A more straight-forward choice might have even been <a href="https://code.janeasystems.com/nodejs-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nodejs-mobile</a>, a recommendation we received quickly from the <a href="https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mapeo</a> team, after asking for it far too late.</p><p>When we started we also were not aware of publication <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev88f5c7bf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difficulties in the AppStore</a> (<a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/regulation/cryptology/how-to-submit-an-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specifically france</a>) due to long-standing rules on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States#Current_status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptographic exports</a> or limitations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_the_import_of_cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">importing cryptographic in parts of the world</a>. China also put out new <a href="https://www.insideprivacy.com/data-security/china-enacts-encryption-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto laws</a>.</p><p>In short, we need to rethink our strategy for getting dat-compatible and fast cryptography to work on a mobile phone. <img src="/img/external/fair-use/screenshot-subscribe-button.png" alt="Subscribe" class="inline__image"> to our <a href="https://github.com/consento-org/mobile/issues/90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github issue #90</a> to follow our progress.</p><hr><p>You can have a look at the Consento mobile app right now → <a href="https://github.com/consento-org/mobile/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Releases</a>.</p><p>The version v1.0.2 is still a very early preview, but it may inspire you.</p><p>In the meanwhile, we will be working on several improvements.
