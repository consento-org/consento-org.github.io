Spear phishing attacks are behind 95% of breaches in enterprise networks, according to Cisco.</li><li><strong>Ransomware</strong> - In 2020, combined ransomware demands reached $1.4B. Ransomware ranks as the third most popular malware causing data breaches.</li><li><strong>DDoS attack</strong> - Just for the first half of 2020, there were 4.83M DDoS attacks attempted. Besides increasing traffic, cybersecurity experts stress that criminals use AI to perform DDoS. Remote workforces became highly dependent on online services. Any failure of those may cost even more to businesses.</li><li><strong>3rd party software</strong> - Besides hammering your business reputation, the data breach caused by a third party costs $4.29M on average. The third-party vendor ecosystem becomes a pool of vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Cloud Computing Vulnerabilities</strong> - while the cloud computing market keeps growing rapidly, the attempted breaches grew by 250% compared to 2019.

Comment</p><p>Japan is also one of the biggest countries which has numerous business activities between Europe, and we see an increasing awareness of GDPR in Japan. On 27th February, we had an opportunity to give a webinar at Project DS run by Mr. Hiroshi Sonoda from Yamato Logistics, and we introduced the narrative of GDPR in the European context, and how Consento as a startup supported by NGI Ledger program is trying to offer the solution.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="background-of-gdpr-and-european-values-on-privacy---europes-frontline-attempt-to-create-a-new-internet-space"></a>âBackground of GDPR and European Values on Privacy - Europeâs Frontline Attempt to Create a New Internet Spaceâ<a class="hash-link" href="#background-of-gdpr-and-european-values-on-privacy---europes-frontline-attempt-to-create-a-new-internet-space" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was officially launched in Europe in 2018, there has been a lot of focus in Europe on data privacy considerations and the use of decentralized networks such as blockchain. Considering the huge fines for violations and the risk of damaging companyâs reputation, it is important that not only European companies but also Japanese companies that exchange data with Europe take action. With presenting the example of Consento developing GDPR compliant data privacy apps, we discussed on the current data privacy situation in Europe right now.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="whats-project-ds"></a>Whatâs Project DS?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-project-ds" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Project DS is a closed community of 100+ people in various businesses to foster digital transformation in Japan, and the aim is to learn from each other through presentations and networking.</p><p>The organizer, Mr. Sonoda is a member of the SAAJ (System Auditors Association Japan), the Institute of Actuaries of Japan, and the ITPS (Japan Management Association).

I think it will be difficult to penetrate the market unless the government presents a solid sample. The opt-in/out system is not thoroughly implemented, and this can be seen in both of the person presenting and the receiving end. (System Auditor)*</li><li>It costs us a lot of money just to obtain and maintain the Privacy Mark. However, the content of the Privacy Mark seems to be quite late compared to the case study presented here, and the Privacy Mark will probably not be approved if it has to comply with GDPR. The Privacy Mark is supposed to be an organization that examines whether or not personal information is being used in a safe and secure manner, but I felt again that the purpose of the Privacy Mark has become more about collecting money. (IT Coordinator)</li><li>I feel that the protection of personal information in the Dietâs answer is too much, and we should have a discussion on how much we are using big data and whether it is allowed. (Recruiter)</li><li>There are a lot of ambiguous policies, and I get the feeling that the user side is not getting the message. (Sales)</li><li>I think it is necessary to put people in charge who are not dragged down by the organization with specialized knowledge and create a system that transcends interests. (System Engineer)</li><li>Data privacy policy will be a hot topic in the coming years, as governments are expected to shift paper-less.(Administrative Lawyer)</li><li>I feel we tend to care about privacy only when the crisis hits. I also think that the current legal system is too inadequate, and not ready. (Anonymous)</li><li>I felt it would be interesting to differentiate ourselves from Europe by creating a society where data is open and can be used by anyone.(Managing Director)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="the-benefits-of-consento"></a>The benefits of Consento<a class="hash-link" href="#the-benefits-of-consento" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>All in all, we felt the strong need to show <strong>the uncomplicated solution for the Japanese market</strong>. Consento provides a user-centric Human Factor Authentication process to secure operations collaboratively based on âShamirâs Secret Sharingâ without the need for passwords and across organizations. Here are the 3 main key features;</p><ol><li><strong>Decentralized</strong>: Consento is a decentralized solution based on peer-to-peer and distributed ledger technologies. There is no centralized server or cloud infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Password-less</strong>: Consento turns your devices into a key, and enables you to build your private MFA (multi-factor-authentication) workflow with your own devices and your trusted relations.</li><li><strong>No single-point-of-failure</strong>: Consento makes authentication more secure through partial keys distributed within your organization (and to your suppliers or customers). No single user is left as a potential point of failure of the system as a whole.</li></ol><hr><footer><small>License: <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a> by <a rel="author" href="https://consento.org/team/yuko">Yuko Fujisawa</a>, <span class="license__year">2021</span></small></footer></div></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/consento-brings-data-security-to-remote-workplace-management">How Consento can bring data security in your remote workplace management</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-02-01T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_fNvV">February 1, 2021 Â· 3 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="/team/marc"><img src="/img/tanja/cc-by-nc-nd/team/Marc.svg" alt="Marc Chataigner"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="/team/marc">Marc Chataigner</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle"></small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="remote-workers-bear-a-great-stress-in-collectively-handling-the-privacy-of-company-data"></a>Remote workers bear a great stress in collectively handling the privacy of company data.<a class="hash-link" href="#remote-workers-bear-a-great-stress-in-collectively-handling-the-privacy-of-company-data" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p><strong>For many of us, remote working is here to stay</strong><br>
Beyond the inconveniency of mixing up personal and professional spheres 24/7, remote working brings along another source of stress for remote workers, and to those in charge of maintaining the company data privacy. Now that devices are connected and used outside the company network, the risk of mishandling passwords or using unsecure networks has become higher than ever. </p><hr><blockquote><p>Ownership v/s Controllability - &quot;(data) <em>ownership</em> has turned out be a double-edged sword. It can be taken to motivate marketization, to harness the economic potential of data, and to put data subjects in a position to sell their data and thereby to receive a share in the value that gets generated from it. But at the same time, at least some versions of data ownership also pose significant constraints on this undertaking. Two worries are that intimate things are being alienated, and that losses of control loom for data subjects once their data is introduced into the market. As a consequence, care should be taken that marketization aligns withârather than undercutsâthe ideal of <em>controllability</em>.&quot;

Most of companies relie on a netwrok of external contractors and suppliers, for translation work, transcription, accounting, legal work, etc. Building a trustworthy partnership often starts with verified credentials, or asking for referals, in order to discard fraudulent candidates. Eventually, these verified CVs and confidential data about contractors become too valuable to be losely shared over emails or cloud services. The agency&#x27;s reputation depends on it.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Translation Scammers - &quot;As a whole, CV theft and translator impersonation are some of the most widespread scams. In 2017 alone, Translation Scammer exposed 5,055 new scammer IDs. Thatâs 36 new scammer IDs per month.&quot;

How often do freelance translators or transcriptors end up using online tools by conveniency? In doing so, they put the agency&#x27;s efforts to keep data confidential at risk.

Consento aims at delivering a novel way to securely store confidential data encrypted without central cloud solution, and access them without depending on complex passwords. Instead, with Consento users can request the consents of peers they have decided to rely on. Such a new way to secure confidential data requires appropriate <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-better-notifications-ux-permission-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX</a> (user experience) &amp; <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-ux-aware-design-framework/?ref=heydesigner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI</a> (user interface) to guide users in handling data privacy. But before discussing about the right UX/UI, we need to discuss a bit about a fundamental object: trust.</p><p>Indeed, before it comes to build trust in the UI, we need to build trust in the system. And before the system, there is the belief in the system. Consento story requires quite some thoughts about various forms of trust: trust in the <em>system</em> build by the web of devices, and in the other <em>peers</em> who act as trustees, if not also trust in the Consento <em>business</em> and team itself. So, to start with, what do we speak about when we speak about trust?</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="trust"></a>Trust<a class="hash-link" href="#trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We like the definition of trust as <em>&quot;a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of another&quot;</em>(<em><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.1998.926617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rousseau et al., 1998</a></em>). Trust depends both on the individual <em>abilities to trust</em> and on the <em>trustworthiness</em> another is able to display.</p><p>Said otherwise, trust is neither a cognitive process nor an innate human feature, it is both (<em><a href="https://www.academia.edu/39355650/The_Roots_of_Trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MÃºjdricza, 2019</a></em>). Studies have shown that trust is an a priori given human faculty, and therefore the possibility of trust is always present. But visual cues, human contexts and past experiences affect positively or negatively the level of trust. <strong>Trust happens to be &#x27;learned&#x27; more than &#x27;earned&#x27;</strong>, and it requires a certain affective warmth for a start.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="contemporary-online-experiences-of-trust"></a>Contemporary online experiences of trust<a class="hash-link" href="#contemporary-online-experiences-of-trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Internet users experience online services as a fast pace changing context.  They regularly confront with new offerings, new companies, new standards, etc. In such an uncertain context, the aspect of trustworthiness can be built on social constructs like <em>reliability</em> and on individual constructs like <em>integrity </em>(<em><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.1998.926617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rousseau et al., 1998</a></em>).</p><p>Among the services internet users experience online (<em><a href="https://journalofcloudcomputing.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13677-019-0129-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">van der Werff et al., 2019</a></em>), display of trustworthiness emerge on levels such as reputation systems, third party endorsement, transparency mechanisms, etc. And novel ones keep on emerging.</p><ul><li>The <strong>reputation systems</strong> provide a hint about trustworthiness based on other peers&#x27; previous experiences, as well as an incentive to behave trustworthy. Think for instance about peer-to-peer platforms tw-ways rating systems.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/external/fair-use/blablacar-trust-level.png" class="kg-image" alt="Trust system relevancy.Illustration on the amount of level of trust by bla-bla-car.

Blablacar is a carpooling service.</figcaption></figure><p>In the case of a decentralised architecture like Consento, with no central platform enforcing the rules, that system in itself might be less effective than the reputation in real life of these peers. Research (<em><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2012/trust-in-advertising--paid-owned-and-earned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nielsen, 2012</a></em>) have demonstrated also that despite a tendency to trust more people who are similar to us, high reputation of peers (and stakeholders) eventually beats strong similarity among peers.</p><ul><li>The <strong>endorsement by third parties</strong> such as insurance companies, governmental institutions or civil origins is never a discrediting thing to get. Commercial companies also rely on customers&#x27; endorsements. However, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/authority-principle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> report that online consumers pay little attention to endorsement itself. Third party endorsements bring on credibility more than trust.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/external/fair-use/dropbox-third-party-endrosement.png" class="kg-image" alt="Third parties endorsement from customers, example of Dropbox website.

Fairphone for instance, discloses its full supply chain as a token for its commitment to transparency. On this aspect, Consento intends to embed transparency at its core, even though <em>transparency _might be a concept antinomic with keeping data confidentially _hidden</em> (this will be the topic of the next article eventually).</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/external/fair-use/fairphone-supply-chain.png" class="kg-image" alt="Map of the Fairphone supply Chain.

A personal dramatic event, or a worldwide pandemic for instance, do impact people&#x27;s ability to trust each other or their institutions. Even if Consento is first a digital tool, we remain aware that the evolution of people&#x27;s trust capacities happens mainly off-line.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#x27;nudge&#x27; approach</a> represent an interesting look into that matter. Humans are inherently biased cognitively. For instance, we would rather avoid loosing than risking to win, we weight the same information differently depending on the credits we give to the speaker, we assess value differently depending on the initial frame given to us to look at the matter, etc.</p><p>We have to remember that Cass Sustein and Richard Thaller approach spurred discussion on how much governments or corporations should be allowed to &#x27;nudge&#x27; us to do what they want us to do. But <strong>when we speak about trust, we should not dismiss our cognitive biases, because before being rational, we are first human</strong>.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="roadmap"></a>Roadmap<a class="hash-link" href="#roadmap" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>So here are the track on which we&#x27;ll work and test our assumptions : build on peer&#x27;s IRL reputation, third party endorsement and transparency mechanisms.
