However, the tricky part is that this regulation goes beyond the border if you deal with personal data linked to users residing within EEA.
Comment</p><p>Japan is also one of the biggest countries which has numerous business activities between Europe, and we see an increasing awareness of GDPR in Japan. On 27th February, we had an opportunity to give a webinar at Project DS run by Mr. Hiroshi Sonoda from Yamato Logistics, and we introduced the narrative of GDPR in the European context, and how Consento as a startup supported by NGI Ledger program is trying to offer the solution.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="background-of-gdpr-and-european-values-on-privacy---europes-frontline-attempt-to-create-a-new-internet-space"></a>“Background of GDPR and European Values on Privacy - Europe’s Frontline Attempt to Create a New Internet Space”<a class="hash-link" href="#background-of-gdpr-and-european-values-on-privacy---europes-frontline-attempt-to-create-a-new-internet-space" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was officially launched in Europe in 2018, there has been a lot of focus in Europe on data privacy considerations and the use of decentralized networks such as blockchain. Considering the huge fines for violations and the risk of damaging company’s reputation, it is important that not only European companies but also Japanese companies that exchange data with Europe take action. With presenting the example of Consento developing GDPR compliant data privacy apps, we discussed on the current data privacy situation in Europe right now.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="whats-project-ds"></a>What’s Project DS?<a class="hash-link" href="#whats-project-ds" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Project DS is a closed community of 100+ people in various businesses to foster digital transformation in Japan, and the aim is to learn from each other through presentations and networking.</p><p>The organizer, Mr. Sonoda is a member of the SAAJ (System Auditors Association Japan), the Institute of Actuaries of Japan, and the ITPS (Japan Management Association). After working for Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Company’s Information Systems Department, The Meijiseimei Asset Management of America INC (NY), and Yamato Autoworks Co. He has worked as a Board Member, PM, PMO, and Solution Consultant for general-purpose computer system development, Open system development, and AI evangelist. He is also an auditor for an architectural company, a consultant for an IT-related company, a representative for a DX project, and an advisor for public insurance. He has a strong passion for fostering Digital Transformation in Japan.</p><p>About 30+ DX enthusiasts participated in our webinar, and we had some very interesting discussions on the Japanese values on data privacy and the issues on privacy mark (The biggest 3rd party certification for data privacy in Japan).</p><p>We implemented a survey using 5-point scale after the webinar. According to the feedbacks, 53% of the participants feel the strong relevancy of GDPR to their business and daily work-flow, and 60% feel Japan should implement the strong data privacy policy as GDPR.</p><p>Many of them see challenges in Japan’s data privacy compliance policy, and here are some interesting feedbacks.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="perspectives-of-the-webinar-participants-on-privacy-data-handling-in-japan"></a>Perspectives of the webinar participants on privacy data handling in Japan<a class="hash-link" href="#perspectives-of-the-webinar-participants-on-privacy-data-handling-in-japan" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><blockquote><p>Question : <em>&quot;What do you think is a challenge in the way the Japanese government handles data?&quot;</em></p></blockquote><ul><li>I have been advocating the need for this for 3 years now, but I feel that there is still a lack of awareness in Japan. I think it will be difficult to penetrate the market unless the government presents a solid sample. The opt-in/out system is not thoroughly implemented, and this can be seen in both of the person presenting and the receiving end. (System Auditor)*</li><li>It costs us a lot of money just to obtain and maintain the Privacy Mark. However, the content of the Privacy Mark seems to be quite late compared to the case study presented here, and the Privacy Mark will probably not be approved if it has to comply with GDPR. The Privacy Mark is supposed to be an organization that examines whether or not personal information is being used in a safe and secure manner, but I felt again that the purpose of the Privacy Mark has become more about collecting money. (IT Coordinator)</li><li>I feel that the protection of personal information in the Diet’s answer is too much, and we should have a discussion on how much we are using big data and whether it is allowed. (Recruiter)</li><li>There are a lot of ambiguous policies, and I get the feeling that the user side is not getting the message. (Sales)</li><li>I think it is necessary to put people in charge who are not dragged down by the organization with specialized knowledge and create a system that transcends interests. (System Engineer)</li><li>Data privacy policy will be a hot topic in the coming years, as governments are expected to shift paper-less.(Administrative Lawyer)</li><li>I feel we tend to care about privacy only when the crisis hits. I also think that the current legal system is too inadequate, and not ready. (Anonymous)</li><li>I felt it would be interesting to differentiate ourselves from Europe by creating a society where data is open and can be used by anyone.(Managing Director)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-benefits-of-consento"></a>The benefits of Consento<a class="hash-link" href="#the-benefits-of-consento" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>All in all, we felt the strong need to show <strong>the uncomplicated solution for the Japanese market</strong>. Consento provides a user-centric Human Factor Authentication process to secure operations collaboratively based on “Shamir’s Secret Sharing” without the need for passwords and across organizations. Here are the 3 main key features;</p><ol><li><strong>Decentralized</strong>: Consento is a decentralized solution based on peer-to-peer and distributed ledger technologies. There is no centralized server or cloud infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Password-less</strong>: Consento turns your devices into a key, and enables you to build your private MFA (multi-factor-authentication) workflow with your own devices and your trusted relations.</li><li><strong>No single-point-of-failure</strong>: Consento makes authentication more secure through partial keys distributed within your organization (and to your suppliers or customers).

Beyond the inconveniency of mixing up personal and professional spheres 24/7, remote working brings along another source of stress for remote workers, and to those in charge of maintaining the company data privacy. Now that devices are connected and used outside the company network, the risk of mishandling passwords or using unsecure networks has become higher than ever. </p><hr><blockquote><p>Ownership v/s Controllability - &quot;(data) <em>ownership</em> has turned out be a double-edged sword. It can be taken to motivate marketization, to harness the economic potential of data, and to put data subjects in a position to sell their data and thereby to receive a share in the value that gets generated from it. But at the same time, at least some versions of data ownership also pose significant constraints on this undertaking. Two worries are that intimate things are being alienated, and that losses of control loom for data subjects once their data is introduced into the market. As a consequence, care should be taken that marketization aligns with—rather than undercuts—the ideal of <em>controllability</em>.&quot;

Most of companies relie on a netwrok of external contractors and suppliers, for translation work, transcription, accounting, legal work, etc. Building a trustworthy partnership often starts with verified credentials, or asking for referals, in order to discard fraudulent candidates. Eventually, these verified CVs and confidential data about contractors become too valuable to be losely shared over emails or cloud services. The agency&#x27;s reputation depends on it.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Translation Scammers - &quot;As a whole, CV theft and translator impersonation are some of the most widespread scams. In 2017 alone, Translation Scammer exposed 5,055 new scammer IDs. That’s 36 new scammer IDs per month.&quot;
<a href="https://word-connection.fr/translation-scammers-the-dark-side-of-the-translation-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(Word Connection Japanlization ; 2020:26)</a></p></blockquote><hr><p><strong>The contractor should not ruin the agency&#x27;s privacy efforts by using online tools either.</strong><br>
How often do freelance translators or transcriptors end up using online tools by conveniency? In doing so, they put the agency&#x27;s efforts to keep data confidential at risk. Onboarding freelancers to develop a simple security and privacy hygiene ends up being costly. In the end, the agency resolves to share the information and guidances and just hopes for the best.</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/external/unsplash/markuswinkler_gLdJnQFcIXE_cut.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Sharing confidential files with suppliers means losing control and making others responsible for your data."><footer><small>License: <a rel="license" href="https://unsplash.com/license">Unsplash</a> by <a rel="author" href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler">@markuswinkler</a></small></footer><figcaption>Consento app makes confidential file sharing undercontrol and stress-free.</figcaption></figure><hr><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="with-consento-embed-data-security-and-authenticity-within-your-network-of-contractors"></a>With Consento, embed data security and authenticity within your network of contractors.<a class="hash-link" href="#with-consento-embed-data-security-and-authenticity-within-your-network-of-contractors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>With Consento app, the verfied credentials of the one at the origin of the CVs or confidential information are linked to the shared files themselves.

Consento aims at delivering a novel way to securely store confidential data encrypted without central cloud solution, and access them without depending on complex passwords. Instead, with Consento users can request the consents of peers they have decided to rely on. Such a new way to secure confidential data requires appropriate <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-better-notifications-ux-permission-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UX</a> (user experience) &amp; <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-ux-aware-design-framework/?ref=heydesigner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI</a> (user interface) to guide users in handling data privacy. But before discussing about the right UX/UI, we need to discuss a bit about a fundamental object: trust.</p><p>Indeed, before it comes to build trust in the UI, we need to build trust in the system. And before the system, there is the belief in the system. Consento story requires quite some thoughts about various forms of trust: trust in the <em>system</em> build by the web of devices, and in the other <em>peers</em> who act as trustees, if not also trust in the Consento <em>business</em> and team itself. So, to start with, what do we speak about when we speak about trust?</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="trust"></a>Trust<a class="hash-link" href="#trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We like the definition of trust as <em>&quot;a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of the intentions or behaviour of another&quot;</em>(<em><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.1998.926617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rousseau et al., 1998</a></em>). Trust depends both on the individual <em>abilities to trust</em> and on the <em>trustworthiness</em> another is able to display.</p><p>Said otherwise, trust is neither a cognitive process nor an innate human feature, it is both (<em><a href="https://www.academia.edu/39355650/The_Roots_of_Trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mújdricza, 2019</a></em>). Studies have shown that trust is an a priori given human faculty, and therefore the possibility of trust is always present. But visual cues, human contexts and past experiences affect positively or negatively the level of trust. <strong>Trust happens to be &#x27;learned&#x27; more than &#x27;earned&#x27;</strong>, and it requires a certain affective warmth for a start.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contemporary-online-experiences-of-trust"></a>Contemporary online experiences of trust<a class="hash-link" href="#contemporary-online-experiences-of-trust" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Internet users experience online services as a fast pace changing context.  They regularly confront with new offerings, new companies, new standards, etc. In such an uncertain context, the aspect of trustworthiness can be built on social constructs like <em>reliability</em> and on individual constructs like <em>integrity </em>(<em><a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amr.1998.926617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rousseau et al., 1998</a></em>).</p><p>Among the services internet users experience online (<em><a href="https://journalofcloudcomputing.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13677-019-0129-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">van der Werff et al., 2019</a></em>), display of trustworthiness emerge on levels such as reputation systems, third party endorsement, transparency mechanisms, etc. And novel ones keep on emerging.</p><ul><li>The <strong>reputation systems</strong> provide a hint about trustworthiness based on other peers&#x27; previous experiences, as well as an incentive to behave trustworthy.

Commercial companies also rely on customers&#x27; endorsements. However, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/authority-principle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> report that online consumers pay little attention to endorsement itself. Third party endorsements bring on credibility more than trust.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/external/fair-use/dropbox-third-party-endrosement.png" class="kg-image" alt="Third parties endorsement from customers, example of Dropbox website.

A personal dramatic event, or a worldwide pandemic for instance, do impact people&#x27;s ability to trust each other or their institutions. Even if Consento is first a digital tool, we remain aware that the evolution of people&#x27;s trust capacities happens mainly off-line.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#x27;nudge&#x27; approach</a> represent an interesting look into that matter. Humans are inherently biased cognitively. For instance, we would rather avoid loosing than risking to win, we weight the same information differently depending on the credits we give to the speaker, we assess value differently depending on the initial frame given to us to look at the matter, etc.</p><p>We have to remember that Cass Sustein and Richard Thaller approach spurred discussion on how much governments or corporations should be allowed to &#x27;nudge&#x27; us to do what they want us to do.

We had a few long and hard discussions, trying to tie down what is necessary for us to figure out. Our priority No. 1 eventually landed on <em>daily usability</em>. We wanted to make sure that whatever product we are building will be useful in everyday life. Ultimately, it means that this has to be on a mobile device; a mobile app.</p><p>This was a problem for us. <em>Yes</em>, we are developers and−<em>yes</em>−we have experience with desktop and server software, but <em>no</em>: our strength is not in mobile apps. We had to learn quickly and make choices. To make this an informed choice we looked at our requirements:</p><ol><li>We need it to be JavaScript based to stay compatible with the <a href="https://datproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dat</a> ecosystem.</li><li>We do not want for the user interface to stutter. This means our code needs to run separately from the UI <em>(in a different thread)</em>.</li></ol><p>Of the two popular choices we found, we went with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React Native</a> over <a href="https://www.nativescript.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NativeScript</a>. It seems easier to find people with React Native experience. It has a pretty good reputation and we wanted to use React for the user interface. Choosing it seemed the straight-forward choice.</p><p>React Native can be used as-is, but for quicker development we learned that <a href="https://expo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expo.io</a> is really comfortable. Expo limits React Native to a pre-defined set of extensions. This restriction allows the immediate installation on any device, quickly. No need to wait for slow build or publishing processes. − <em>Cool, we definitely want that!</em></p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="design-process"></a>Design Process<a class="hash-link" href="#design-process" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We want to use Open-Source software for as many tasks as possible, as it allows contributors to join freely and quickly. Sadly, we have not found a free design software that works for us. <a href="https://www.sketch.com/get/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sketch</a> is reasonably cheap for a design software, can be used offline, allows some hacking with the format and is overall the only choice we could see−even though it runs only on MacOS. <em>(though .sketch files can be edited using <a href="https://icons8.com/lunacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lunacy</a> on Windows)</em></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/consento/cc-by-nc-sa/design.png" class="kg-image" alt="Consento, In sketch, as mock and on the device."><footer><small>License: <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a> by <a rel="author" href="https://consento.org/team">Consento</a></small></footer><figcaption>From sketch to mockup to prototype. Marc made some nice designs for us.</figcaption></figure><p>With the design ready we need to turn it into code. We wanted to automate that so we also informed ourselves here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://builderx.io/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BuilderX</a> looked professional but has a steep price tag of 15$/month/person and the output wasn&#x27;t good to use in our opinion. Repeat output would clash with expo and typescript and we had to improve the output by hand.</li><li><a href="https://zeplin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeplin.io</a> is useful for communication and is okay for a copy &amp; paste process but in the long run was going to be painful for updates: What did we already update? Where is the difference between design and code? How do we add the non-trivial features?</li><li><a href="https://github.com/nanohop/sketch-to-react-native" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sketch-to-react-native</a> does sound promising but it exports to JavaScript <em>(and we work with TypeScript)</em> and the output is not suitable for repeat exports. This would allow us to export once and any future update would be problematic.</li></ul><p>After testing a few alternatives we knew what we needed.</p><ol><li>It needs to be able to change the Sketch file repeatedly without breaking the rest of the code.</li><li>It needs to output all the things we need: images, fonts, elements.</li><li>It needs to be free or cheap.</li></ol><p>Since we couldn&#x27;t find any tool to do that, we wrote it ourselves. 🤓 ↓</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="hello-expo-export"></a>Hello, expo-export!<a class="hash-link" href="#hello-expo-export" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>To get the workflow right we built in parallel to our first app <a href="https://github.com/consento-org/expo-export" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expo-export</a>! It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free and opensource software</a>, that you can add as a plugin to Sketch.

Now, when we create changes in Sketch we can see the updates immediately<em>(-ish)</em> in the mobile app.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/img/consento/cc-by-nc-sa/screen-recording-live-update.gif" class="kg-image" alt="screen capture showing an iphone simulator updated as the export process in sketch is executed."><footer><small>License: <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-NC-SA</a> by <a rel="author" href="https://consento.org/team">Consento</a></small></footer><figcaption>Simulator (or device) is updated quickly after sketch export is triggered.</figcaption></figure><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="security--performance"></a>Security &amp; Performance<a class="hash-link" href="#security--performance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The last topic for this post is about performance. If you try to use Consento right now on a slower device, Consento will be slow! Particularly when adding a new Relation or adding a new file to a vault. The reason for this performance issue is tied to our initial choices <em>(back in the first section)</em>. In order to work with dat, we need to rely on a specific encryption system <em>(libsodium)</em> that is not working fast on react-native.</p><p>We thought initially that this should be the smaller issue and will be easily improved later-on but it turns out that encryption on mobile devices is a pretty big deal. The current version works more-or-less but because of time constraints the current solution is not compatible with dat. 😱</p><p>Maybe we should have gone with NativeScript as a platform? NativeScript has a synchronous <a href="https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-libsodium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libsodium plugin</a> after all, though <a href="https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-libsodium#ios-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">without iOS support</a>. A more straight-forward choice might have even been <a href="https://code.janeasystems.com/nodejs-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nodejs-mobile</a>, a recommendation we received quickly from the <a href="https://www.digital-democracy.org/mapeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mapeo</a> team, after asking for it far too late.</p><p>When we started we also were not aware of publication <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev88f5c7bf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">difficulties in the AppStore</a> (<a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/regulation/cryptology/how-to-submit-an-application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specifically france</a>) due to long-standing rules on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States#Current_status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptographic exports</a> or limitations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_the_import_of_cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">importing cryptographic in parts of the world</a>. China also put out new <a href="https://www.insideprivacy.com/data-security/china-enacts-encryption-law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto laws</a>.</p><p>In short, we need to rethink our strategy for getting dat-compatible and fast cryptography to work on a mobile phone. <img src="/img/external/fair-use/screenshot-subscribe-button.png" alt="Subscribe" class="inline__image"> to our <a href="https://github.com/consento-org/mobile/issues/90" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github issue #90</a> to follow our progress.</p><hr><p>You can have a look at the Consento mobile app right now → <a href="https://github.com/consento-org/mobile/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Releases</a>.</p><p>The version v1.0.2 is still a very early preview, but it may inspire you.</p><p>In the meanwhile, we will be working on several improvements.
