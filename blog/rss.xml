            <description><![CDATA[The concept behind Consento - Human-Factor Authentication - requires trust. Consento aims at delivering a novel way to securely store confidential data encrypted without central cloud solution, and access them without depending on complex passwords.

            <description><![CDATA[The goal of Consento is to provide a free and open technology for humans. Neither free nor open rimes well with profit though, and our initial team has been thinking about how to make Consento viable from the start.
