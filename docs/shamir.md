Shamir's Secret Sharing is an algorithm created by cryptographer Adi Shamir. It refers to the method of distributing a secret (e.g a key) among a group of peaple, who each receive a (unique) part of the secret. The secret can be reconstructed when a sufficient amount of shares are combined togehter. Individual parts are useless on their own.
