## History
The idea behind Consento was born in the head of <img src="/img/tanja/cc-by-nc-nd/team//Martin.svg" className="inline__image"/> [Martin](/team/martin), but it turned only into an actual project when <img src="/img/tanja/cc-by-nc-nd/team//Daniel.svg" className="inline__image"/> [Daniel](/team/daniel) pursued it with vigor and persistency. <img src="/img/tanja/cc-by-nc-nd/team//Marc.svg" className="inline__image"/> [Marc](/team/marc) joined at the time to flesh out a clearer vision of the project. We learned that a good user experience was the key to our success and <img src="/img/tanja/cc-by-nc-nd/team//Tanja.svg" className="inline__image"/> [Tanja](/team/tanja) joined us to improve our work and extend our vision. Eager helping us with our website, <img src="/img/tanja/cc-by-nc-nd/team//Nathaniel.svg" className="inline__image"/> [Nathaniel](/team/nathaniel) joined us for his first public OSS effort. Dedicated to the discovery of our customers needs and enagaged in making data privacy understandable to everyone, <img src="/img/tanja/cc-by-nc-nd/team//Yuko.svg" className="inline__image"/> [Yuko](/team/yuko) is now one of Consento's key asset.
