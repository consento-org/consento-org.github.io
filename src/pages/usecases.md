> **TLDR;** Consento is developing fast. We keep on expanding use cases for which handling data privacy collectively matters a great deal.

## Remote workers bear a great stress in collectively handling the privacy of company data.

__For many of us, remote working is here to stay__<br/>
Beyond the inconveniency of mixing up personal and professional spheres 24/7, remote working brings along another source of stress for remote workers, and to those in charge of maintaining the company data privacy. Now that devices are connected and used outside the company network, the risk of mishandling passwords or using unsecure networks has become higher than ever. 

__Who should bear the stress of company data privacy?__<br/>
No matter how much technology the company might invest in, the human factor remains a key point of failure for the company data security. It is also the key to company data security itself. 

### With Consento, distribute and manage the responsibility of confidential data security.

With Consento app, access to confidential data and company services is secured with the help of co-workers. Even for the work done outside the company secured network, the responsibility of handling company secrets is distributed and the stress of a single person mishandling it is reduced. Consento app enables HR and IT departments to easily onboard all employees, if not suppliers and business partners.

## Sharing data with independent contractors leads many of our confidential data to be out of hand.

__Once the confidential data is shared, it has been copied. It is out of your hand.__<br/>
Most of companies relie on the services of external contractors or suppliers, for translation work, transcription, accounting, legal work, etc. Building a trustworthy partnership often starts with complex NDA. And it is there to stay; the partnership is hard to evolve or update.

__The one who receives the confidential data would prefer not to be responsible for it.__<br/>
Eventually, the smaller entreprises or independent workers who eventually receive the confidential documents they have to work on end up bearing an unecessary responsibility over these files. The sender does not want to give away the files, nor the recipient want to have to secure these files.


### With Consento, share the responsibility without losing control over your data.

With Consento app, the files you send are encrypted and remain in that state until you grant access to them to the people of your choice. You can control on which device, at what time or at which location these files are accessed. 

For the recipients, it means that the files remain in the custody of the client, not theirs. The NDA or other lenghty procedures can be reduced, and so is the stress of amanging the confidential data of others.

__Have you heard how many bitcoin users would have become millionaires, only if they hadn't lost theit password?__<br/>
Bitcoins and distributed ledgers technologies have opened amazing opportunities to secure transactions online. Their technicality make most end-users a bit chill though. More importantly, they transform the end-user as a key "single point of failure".

__Password managers are the solution. But what if you lose the master key?__<br/>
The password manager apps seem to solve the everyday authentication issue. But actually, they just postpone the problem; either end-users may still forget about their master password; either their precious vault with all their precious passwords becomes a centralised vault worth hacking.

### With Consento, secure your wallet credentials for years, without putting all your eggs in the same basket. 

With the Consento app, split your access key in parts and keep those safely stored on different devices, yours and those of your trusted ones. To authenticate, Consento gather the pieces on request. No need to remember your password. To keep it safe, consento make sure the partial keys are taken care of and notify you if any action is required from you to ensure your data security.
